# GitHub Actions Runners – GitHub-Hosted and Self-Hosted

## Overview

A **runner** is the machine that executes GitHub Actions jobs.

GitHub supports:
- GitHub-hosted runners
- Self-hosted runners

Choosing the right runner is a **real-world architectural decision**.

---

## GitHub-Hosted Runners

GitHub-hosted runners are:
- Fully managed by GitHub
- Automatically created
- Destroyed after each job

### Supported OS
- Ubuntu
- Windows
- macOS

---

### Characteristics

- No setup required
- Clean environment every run
- Limited customization
- Internet access only

---

### When to Use GitHub-Hosted Runners

- Standard CI pipelines
- Open-source projects
- No internal network dependency
- No custom tooling required

---

## Self-Hosted Runners

Self-hosted runners are:
- Machines you own and manage
- Registered with GitHub
- Persistent across jobs

They can be:
- Physical servers
- Virtual machines
- Cloud instances

---

### Characteristics

- Full environment control
- Access to internal systems
- Persistent state
- Higher responsibility

---

## GitHub-Hosted vs Self-Hosted

| Feature | GitHub-Hosted | Self-Hosted |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Management | GitHub | You |
| Setup | None | Required |
| Custom software | Limited | Full |
| Network access | Public only | Internal allowed |
| Persistence | No | Yes |

---

## How Self-Hosted Runners Communicate

Important concept:
> Self-hosted runners **pull jobs from GitHub**.

They:
- Do NOT require inbound firewall rules
- Poll GitHub for work
- Execute jobs locally
- Send status back to GitHub

---

## Summary

- Runners execute workflows
- GitHub-hosted = easy, limited
- Self-hosted = powerful, controlled
