# GitHub Actions – Introduction

## Overview

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform built directly into GitHub** that allows you to automate:
- Build
- Test
- Scan
- Deploy

based on **events** happening in your GitHub repository.

Unlike traditional CI tools, GitHub Actions does not require a separate server or UI.  
Everything is defined as **code inside the repository**.

## Why GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions solves several real-world problems:

- No need to maintain a separate CI server
- Native integration with GitHub repositories
- Event-driven automation
- Easy onboarding for developers
- Scales well for both small and large projects

---

## What Problems It Solves

Before GitHub Actions:
- External CI tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Tool sprawl
- Extra infrastructure
- Manual integrations

With GitHub Actions:
- CI/CD lives next to the code
- Automation starts on GitHub events
- Infrastructure overhead is reduced

## Core Concepts (High-Level)

| Concept | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| Workflow | CI/CD pipeline definition |
| Event | Trigger that starts a workflow |
| Job | A group of steps |
| Step | Individual command or action |
| Runner | Machine that executes jobs |

---

## Where Workflows Live

All GitHub Actions workflows are stored in:

```text
.github/workflows/
Workflow files use YAML and define:
