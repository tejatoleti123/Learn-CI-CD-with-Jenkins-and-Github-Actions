# CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions – Foundations

Welcome to **CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions – Foundations** 👋  

This repository is designed to help you build a **strong conceptual foundation** in CI/CD before moving into advanced pipelines and real-world projects.

The focus here is on **clarity, fundamentals, and correct understanding**, not rushing into complex implementations.

> A **separate continuation repository** will cover **end-to-end, real-world CI/CD projects** once the fundamentals in this repository are complete.

## Why this repository?

Many learners struggle with CI/CD because:

- Core CI/CD concepts are not clear
- Tools are introduced without explaining *why* they exist
- Tutorials jump straight into pipelines and YAML files
- Jenkins setup itself feels overwhelming

This repository addresses those problems by:

- Starting with **CI/CD basics from scratch**
- Introducing tools **only after concepts are clear**
- Keeping explanations simple, structured, and progressive
- Preparing you for hands-on CI/CD work in later stages

---

## Who should use this repository?

This repository is suitable for:

- Beginners starting with DevOps
- Cloud Engineers (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- System Administrators transitioning into DevOps
- Developers who want to understand CI/CD workflows
- Anyone who wants a **solid CI/CD foundation**

### Recommended knowledge
- Basic Linux usage
- Basic Git commands

No prior Jenkins or GitHub Actions experience is required.

## What this repository covers (at a high level)

In this repository, you will learn:

- What CI/CD is and why it is important
- How CI/CD fits into modern software delivery
- An introduction to Jenkins as a CI/CD tool
- An introduction to GitHub Actions as a CI/CD tool
- How CI/CD tools are structured and used at a high level
- How to prepare your system for CI/CD usage

> Detailed explanations, configurations, and hands-on exercises are provided **inside the respective `.md` files**, not in this README.
