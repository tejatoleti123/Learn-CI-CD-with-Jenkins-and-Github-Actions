# CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions – Foundations

Welcome to **CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions – Foundations** 👋  

This repository is designed to help you build a **strong conceptual foundation** in CI/CD before moving into advanced pipelines and real-world projects.

The focus here is on **clarity, fundamentals, and correct understanding**, not rushing into complex implementations.

> A **separate continuation repository** will cover **end-to-end, real-world CI/CD projects** once the fundamentals in this repository are complete.

## Why this repository?

Many learners struggle with CI/CD because:

- Core CI/CD concepts are not clear
- Tools are introduced without explaining *why* they exist
- Tutorials jump straight into pipelines and YAML files
- Jenkins setup itself feels overwhelming

This repository addresses those problems by:

- Starting with **CI/CD basics from scratch**
- Introducing tools **only after concepts are clear**
- Keeping explanations simple, structured, and progressive
- Preparing you for hands-on CI/CD work in later stages

---

## Who should use this repository?

This repository is suitable for:

- Beginners starting with DevOps
- Cloud Engineers (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- System Administrators transitioning into DevOps
- Anyone who wants a **solid CI/CD foundation**

### Recommended knowledge
- Basic Linux usage
- Basic Git commands

No prior Jenkins or GitHub Actions experience is required.

---

## What this repository covers (at a high level)

In this repository, you will learn:

- What CI/CD is and why it is important
- How CI/CD fits into modern software delivery
- An introduction to Jenkins as a CI/CD tool
- An introduction to GitHub Actions as a CI/CD tool
- How CI/CD tools are structured and used at a high level

> Detailed explanations, configurations, and hands-on exercises are provided **inside the respective `.md` files**, not in this README.

## Repository learning flow

Follow the files **in order**.  
Each file builds on the understanding from the previous one.

## 📘 Table of Contents

This repository is divided into **three logical sections**:
1. CI/CD fundamentals
2. Jenkins (foundational to real-world usage)
3. GitHub Actions (modern, GitHub-native CI/CD)

Follow the sections **in order** for the best learning experience.

### 🔹 CI/CD Fundamentals

This section builds the **conceptual base** required to understand any CI/CD tool.
No tools are introduced until the *why* and *how* of CI/CD are clear.

### 📌 How to use this structure

- Read **top to bottom**
- Do not skip conceptual sections
- Treat Jenkins and GitHub Actions as **complementary tools**
- Focus on understanding *execution flow*, not syntax

This structure is intentional and mirrors how CI/CD is used in real teams.

## Prerequisites (Recommended)

Before starting this repository, familiarity with the following will be helpful:

- Linux command-line basics  
- Git fundamentals (clone, commit, push)

## Final note

CI/CD tools change.  
**CI/CD concepts do not.**

Build the foundation well, and every tool becomes easier to learn.

Happy Learning 🚀
