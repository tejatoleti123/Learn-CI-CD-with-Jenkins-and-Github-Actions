# CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions – Foundations

This repository is the **foundation layer** for learning CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions.  
It is intentionally focused on **concepts, setup, and clarity**, before jumping into hands-on projects.

A **separate continuation repository** will be created for **end-to-end hands-on CI/CD projects**, once the fundamentals here are complete.

---

## Why this repository?

Many learners struggle because:
- CI/CD concepts are not clear
- Jenkins setup itself feels complex
- Tutorials jump directly into pipelines without explaining the basics
- Tool usage is taught without explaining *why* it is needed

This repository solves that by:
- Starting from CI/CD fundamentals
- Explaining Jenkins clearly and patiently
- Providing **detailed installation steps**
- Preparing you for real-world hands-on projects

---

## Who is this repository for?

This repository is ideal for:
- Beginners starting with DevOps
- Cloud Engineers (AWS / Azure / GCP)
- System Administrators moving into DevOps
- Developers who want to understand CI/CD pipelines
- Anyone who wants a **strong Jenkins foundation**

Basic Linux and Git knowledge is recommended.

---

## What you will learn in this repository

- CI/CD fundamentals (from scratch)
- Why CI/CD exists and how it works
- What Jenkins is and why it is used
- Jenkins architecture (Controller and Agent)
- Jenkins installation on:
  - Linux
  - Windows
- Jenkins initial setup and access

> Hands-on CI/CD pipelines and projects will be covered in the **next repository**.
