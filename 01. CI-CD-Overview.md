# CI/CD Basics – Explained from Scratch

This document explains **CI/CD fundamentals from the ground up**.

The goal is to understand:
- What CI/CD is
- Why it exists
- How it fits into modern software delivery
- Why different CI/CD tools exist (and when to use which)

No prior Jenkins or GitHub Actions experience is assumed.

## What is CI (Continuous Integration)?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of **frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository**.

In CI:
- Developers make small changes
- Changes are committed regularly
- Each change triggers automated checks

Typically, CI includes:
- Building the application
- Running automated tests

The purpose of CI is to **detect problems early**, not at release time.

---

## Why CI is Needed (Brief)

Without CI:
- Code is merged late
- Bugs are found close to release
- Fixing issues is risky and time-consuming

With CI:
- Integration happens continuously
- Errors are detected early
- Changes are easier to debug

CI reduces risk by catching problems **as soon as they are introduced**.

---

## What is CD (Continuous Delivery / Deployment)?

**CD** extends CI by automating what happens **after successful builds and tests**.

There are two common models:

### Continuous Delivery
- Build and tests are automatic
- Deployment requires manual approval

Used when:
- Compliance or approvals are required
- Releases are controlled

### Continuous Deployment
- Build, test, and deploy are automatic
- Every successful change can go to production

Used by:
- SaaS platforms
- Cloud-native applications
- High-maturity DevOps teams

## CI/CD Pipeline – High-Level Flow

A CI/CD pipeline is an automated sequence of steps:

1. Developer commits code  
2. Code is stored in Git  
3. Build runs automatically  
4. Tests are executed  
5. Application is packaged  
6. Application is deployed  

Each step depends on the success of the previous one.

---

## Why CI/CD is Important

CI/CD helps teams achieve:
- Faster releases
- Early bug detection
- Reduced manual effort
- Consistent and repeatable processes
- Better collaboration
- Higher confidence in deployments

CI/CD is about **reliability and predictability**, not just speed.

---

## CI/CD Tools (Context)

Common CI/CD tools include:
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- Azure DevOps
- CircleCI

All tools follow the **same CI/CD principles**, but differ in:
- Setup
- Flexibility
- Control
- Operational overhead

This repository focuses on **Jenkins and GitHub Actions** because they represent two widely used but different approaches.

# Choosing Between Jenkins and GitHub Actions

There is **no single best tool**.  
The right choice depends on **context, requirements, and constraints**.

---

## Why Choose GitHub Actions Over Jenkins?

GitHub Actions is often preferred when:

- Source code is already hosted on GitHub
- You want **minimal setup and maintenance**
- You prefer CI/CD configuration as YAML in the repo
- Teams want quick onboarding
- Projects are cloud-native or lightweight

Key advantages:
- No separate CI server to manage
- Native GitHub integration
- Event-driven automation
- Lower operational overhead
- Faster to get started

GitHub Actions is ideal when:
> **Simplicity and tight GitHub integration matter more than deep customization.**

---

## Why Choose Jenkins Over GitHub Actions?

Jenkins is often preferred when:

- You need **full control over the CI/CD environment**
- Workflows are complex or highly customized
- Builds require access to private networks
- You want to run CI/CD outside GitHub
- Legacy systems or non-GitHub SCMs are involved

Key advantages:
- Extremely flexible
- Works with any SCM, cloud, or platform
- Mature plugin ecosystem
- Supports complex enterprise workflows
- Self-hosted and fully controllable

Jenkins is ideal when:
> **Customization, control, and enterprise requirements are critical.**

---

## Important Real-World Note

Many organizations use **both**:
- GitHub Actions for lightweight CI and pull request checks
- Jenkins for complex pipelines, deployments, or private infrastructure

CI/CD tools often **complement each other**, not replace one another.

---

## What CI/CD Is NOT

CI/CD:
- Does not fix poor code quality
- Does not eliminate testing
- Is not a single tool
- Is not only a DevOps responsibility

CI/CD is a **process and culture**, supported by tools.

---

## Key Takeaways

- CI/CD automates software delivery
- CI focuses on early integration and testing
- CD focuses on safe delivery or deployment
- GitHub Actions prioritizes simplicity and GitHub-native workflows
- Jenkins prioritizes flexibility and control
- Concepts matter more than tools

With the fundamentals clear, the next sections dive into **tool-specific implementations**, starting with Jenkins.
