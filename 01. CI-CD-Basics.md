# CI/CD Basics – Explained from Scratch

This document explains CI/CD concepts in a simple and structured way, without assuming prior experience.

---

## What is CI?

CI stands for Continuous Integration.

Continuous Integration means developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository.

Each time code is merged:
- The application is built automatically
- Tests are executed automatically

---

## Why CI is needed

Before CI:
- Developers worked on code for weeks
- Code was merged late
- Bugs were hard to identify
- Integration caused failures

With CI:
- Code is merged frequently
- Errors are detected early
- Code quality improves

---

## What is CD?

CD stands for Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment.

### Continuous Delivery
- Code is built and tested automatically
- Deployment requires manual approval

### Continuous Deployment
- Code is built, tested, and deployed automatically
- No manual intervention

## CI/CD Pipeline – High-Level Flow

    Developer commits code
            ↓
        Git Repository
            ↓
           Build
            ↓
           Test
            ↓
          Package
            ↓
          Deploy

This automated flow is called a CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Why CI/CD is important

- Faster releases
- Reduced manual errors
- Consistent deployments
- Better collaboration
- Improved reliability

---

## Common CI/CD Tools

- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI/CD
- Azure DevOps
- CircleCI

In this repository, we focus on Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

---

## What CI/CD is NOT

- CI/CD is not magic
- CI/CD does not fix bad code
- CI/CD does not remove the need for testing
- CI/CD is not only a DevOps responsibility

CI/CD is a process supported by tools.

---

## Summary

- CI integrates code frequently
- CD delivers or deploys code automatically
- Pipelines automate the entire process
- Jenkins and GitHub Actions are popular CI/CD tools
