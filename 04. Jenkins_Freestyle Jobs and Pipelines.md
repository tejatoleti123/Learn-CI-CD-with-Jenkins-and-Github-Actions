# Jenkins Freestyle Jobs and Pipelines

This document builds on the **CI/CD fundamentals and Jenkins setup** covered earlier.

Here, we introduce **how work is defined and executed in Jenkins**, starting with Freestyle jobs and then moving to Pipelines.

The goal is to understand **how Jenkins thinks and operates**, before diving into complex real-world projects.

# Jenkins Freestyle Jobs

## Overview

**Jenkins Freestyle jobs** are the simplest type of job in Jenkins. They are primarily **UI-driven** and help beginners understand how Jenkins executes tasks step by step.

Freestyle jobs are ideal for learning:
- How Jenkins pulls source code
- How build steps are executed
- How job configuration flows inside Jenkins

This is an important stepping stone before moving to pipelines.

---

## What is a Jenkins Freestyle Job?

A Freestyle job is a:
- Manually configured Jenkins job
- Defined using the Jenkins Web UI
- Sequence of steps executed on an agent

Each job typically includes:
- Source code configuration
- One or more build steps
- Optional post-build actions

---

## What You Will Learn (Freestyle Jobs)

By working with Freestyle jobs, you will learn:

- How Jenkins jobs are created
- How Jenkins integrates with Git repositories
- How shell commands are executed
- How environment variables are used
- How build success and failure are determined
- How to read build logs and console output

---

## Topics Covered (Freestyle Jobs)

- Jenkins job lifecycle
- Source Code Management (Git)
- Build steps (Execute Shell)
- Environment variables
- Job execution flow
- Build logs and troubleshooting
- Build success vs failure

---

## Hands-on Practice (Freestyle Jobs)

You will practice the following:

- Creating a basic Freestyle job
- Pulling code from a GitHub repository
- Running shell commands
- Simulating build failures
- Observing and analyzing Jenkins logs

> Freestyle jobs are used here for **learning purposes**.
> They are not recommended for large-scale or complex CI/CD workflows.

---

## Why Freestyle Jobs Matter

Freestyle jobs help because they are:

- Easy to understand
- UI-driven and visual
- Beginner-friendly
- Excellent for learning Jenkins fundamentals

Once you understand Freestyle jobs, Pipelines become much easier.

---

# Jenkins Pipelines

## Overview

**Jenkins Pipelines** are the modern and recommended way to define CI/CD workflows.

Unlike Freestyle jobs, pipelines are defined as **code**, usually in a file called `Jenkinsfile`.

This approach is known as **Pipeline as Code**.

---

## What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A Jenkins Pipeline is:
- A set of steps written as code
- Stored alongside application source code
- Executed automatically by Jenkins

Pipelines enable:
- Version control of CI/CD logic
- Reusability
- Better collaboration
- Consistent execution across environments

---

## Pipeline as Code (Why It Matters)

Defining pipelines as code allows you to:

- Track changes using Git
- Review CI/CD logic like application code
- Reproduce pipelines easily
- Avoid manual UI-based configuration drift

This is the industry-standard approach.

---

## What You Will Learn (Pipelines)

You will learn:

- What Jenkins Pipelines are
- Declarative vs Scripted pipelines (conceptually)
- Jenkinsfile structure
- Stages and steps
- Agents and environment variables
- Basic error handling
- Pipeline visualization in Jenkins UI

---

## Topics Covered (Pipelines)

- Jenkinsfile syntax (high level)
- Declarative pipeline basics
- Pipeline stages and steps
- Agent selection
- Environment variables
- Pipeline execution flow
- Reading pipeline logs

---

## Hands-on Practice (Pipelines)

You will practice:

- Creating your first Jenkins Pipeline
- Writing a basic Jenkinsfile
- Connecting pipeline to Git
- Running multi-stage pipelines
- Debugging basic pipeline failures

---

## Sample Pipeline Flow (Conceptual)

A typical CI pipeline follows this sequence:

1. Checkout source code
2. Build the application
3. Run automated tests
4. Archive build artifacts

Each stage runs only if the previous stage succeeds.

---

## Why Pipelines Are Preferred

Pipelines are preferred because they:

- Treat CI/CD as code
- Improve collaboration
- Scale better than Freestyle jobs
- Align with modern DevOps practices

---

## Key Takeaway

- Freestyle jobs help you understand Jenkins basics
- Pipelines are the recommended long-term approach
- Learning both builds strong Jenkins fundamentals

---

## What’s Next?

This repository stops after **foundational Jenkins usage**.

In the continuation repository, we will cover:
- Docker with Jenkins
- Jenkins pipelines in real-world scenarios
- GitHub Actions
- End-to-end CI/CD projects

You are now ready to move from **understanding Jenkins** to **using it effectively**.
