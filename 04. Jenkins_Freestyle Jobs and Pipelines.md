# Jenkins Freestyle Jobs

## Overview

This repository builds on the **CI/CD foundations and Jenkins setup** covered earlier.
Here, we focus on **Jenkins Freestyle jobs**, which are the simplest way to understand how Jenkins works.

Freestyle jobs help you learn:
- How Jenkins pulls source code
- How builds are executed
- How job configuration flows inside Jenkins

This is an important step before moving to pipelines.

---

## What You Will Learn

- What a Jenkins Freestyle job is
- Creating and configuring Freestyle jobs
- Integrating Git repositories
- Running shell commands as build steps
- Understanding build triggers
- Post-build actions

---

## Topics Covered

- Jenkins job lifecycle
- Source Code Management (Git)
- Build steps (Execute Shell)
- Environment variables
- Job execution and logs
- Build success vs failure

---

## Hands-on Labs

- Create a basic Freestyle job
- Pull code from GitHub
- Run shell commands
- Simulate build failures
- View and analyze Jenkins logs

---

## Why Freestyle Jobs?

- Easy to understand
- UI-driven
- Good for beginners
- Helps understand Jenkins fundamentals

# Jenkins Pipelines

## Overview

This repository introduces **Jenkins Pipelines**, the modern and recommended way to define CI/CD workflows.

Unlike Freestyle jobs, pipelines are defined as **code** using a `Jenkinsfile`, making them:
- Version controlled
- Reusable
- Scalable

---

## What You Will Learn

- What Jenkins Pipelines are
- Pipeline-as-Code concept
- Declarative vs Scripted pipelines
- Jenkinsfile structure
- Stages and steps
- Agents and environment variables

---

## Topics Covered

- Jenkinsfile syntax
- Declarative pipeline basics
- Pipeline stages and steps
- Using agents
- Environment variables
- Basic error handling
- Pipeline visualization

---

## Hands-on Labs

- Create your first Jenkins pipeline
- Write a basic Jenkinsfile
- Configure pipeline from Git
- Run multi-stage pipelines
- Debug pipeline failures

---

## Why Pipelines Matter

- Everything as code
- Easy collaboration
- Supports CI/CD best practices
- Industry standard approach

---

## Outcome

After completing this repository, you will:
- Write and manage Jenkins pipelines
- Understand CI pipeline structure
- Move away from UI-only configurations
