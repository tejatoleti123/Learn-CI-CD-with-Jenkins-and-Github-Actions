# Jenkins Freestyle Jobs and Pipelines

This document builds on the **CI/CD fundamentals and Jenkins setup** covered earlier.

Here, we explain **how work is defined, organized, and executed in Jenkins**, starting with Freestyle jobs and then moving to Pipelines.

The focus is on understanding:
- How Jenkins executes work
- How CI/CD pipelines are structured
- What each pipeline stage does in real projects
- Which tools are commonly used at each stage

This prepares you for **real-world CI/CD pipelines**, not just demos.

# Jenkins Freestyle Jobs

## Overview

**Jenkins Freestyle jobs** are the simplest job type in Jenkins.

They are:
- UI-driven
- Step-by-step
- Easy to visualize

Freestyle jobs help beginners understand:
- How Jenkins pulls source code
- How build steps are executed
- How success and failure are determined

They are a **learning tool**, not a long-term CI/CD solution.

---

## What is a Jenkins Freestyle Job?

A Freestyle job is:
- Configured manually using the Jenkins Web UI
- Executed on a Jenkins agent
- Made up of ordered build steps

A typical Freestyle job contains:
- Source Code Management (Git)
- One or more build steps
- Optional post-build actions

Each step runs **sequentially**.

---

## What You Learn from Freestyle Jobs

Freestyle jobs help you understand:

- Jenkins job lifecycle
- Git integration
- Command execution using shell
- Environment variables
- Build status (SUCCESS / FAILURE)
- Console output and logs

This knowledge directly transfers to pipelines.

---

## Why Freestyle Jobs Are Limited

Freestyle jobs:
- Are not version controlled
- Are hard to replicate
- Do not scale well
- Become difficult to manage in large teams

This is why **pipelines exist**.

---

# Jenkins Pipelines

## Overview

**Jenkins Pipelines** define CI/CD workflows **as code**.

Instead of clicking through the UI:
- The entire workflow is written in a `Jenkinsfile`
- Stored in Git alongside application code
- Executed consistently by Jenkins

This approach is known as **Pipeline as Code**.

---

## What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A Jenkins Pipeline is:
- A structured CI/CD workflow
- Written using Groovy-based syntax
- Executed stage by stage
- Fully automated

Pipelines make CI/CD:
- Repeatable
- Reviewable
- Scalable
- Production-ready

---

## Declarative vs Scripted Pipelines (Conceptual)

Jenkins supports two pipeline styles:

Declarative Pipeline:
- Simple and structured
- Easier for beginners
- Uses predefined syntax
- Recommended for most use cases

Scripted Pipeline:
- More flexible
- Fully Groovy-based
- Used for complex logic
- Requires deeper Jenkins knowledge

In this repository, we focus on **Declarative Pipelines**.

---

## Pipeline Structure (Core Concepts)

A typical Jenkins pipeline consists of:

- Agent
- Stages
- Steps
- Post actions

Each pipeline is divided into **stages**, and each stage contains **steps**.

---

# Pipeline Stages Explained (Very Important)

Below is a **real-world pipeline breakdown**, stage by stage.

---

## Stage 1: Checkout (Source Code)

### Purpose
- Pull the latest code from version control

### What happens
- Jenkins connects to Git
- Downloads the source code
- Prepares workspace for the build

### Common Tools Used
- Git
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

This stage ensures Jenkins is working with the **latest code**.

---

## Stage 2: Build

### Purpose
- Compile or prepare the application

### What happens
- Dependencies are resolved
- Application is built or packaged

### Common Tools Used
- Maven (Java)
- Gradle (Java)
- npm / yarn (Node.js)
- Make (C/C++)
- Shell scripts

A failure here means the code **cannot be built**.

---

## Stage 3: Test

### Purpose
- Validate application behavior

### What happens
- Automated tests are executed
- Test results are generated

### Common Tools Used
- JUnit / TestNG (Java)
- pytest (Python)
- Jest / Mocha (JavaScript)
- Selenium (UI testing)

If tests fail, the pipeline **stops immediately**.

---

## Stage 4: Code Quality / Security (Optional but Common)

### Purpose
- Ensure code quality and security

### What happens
- Static code analysis
- Vulnerability scanning

### Common Tools Used
- SonarQube
- Checkstyle
- ESLint
- Snyk
- OWASP Dependency-Check

This stage improves **long-term reliability**.

---

## Stage 5: Package / Artifact Creation

### Purpose
- Create deployable artifacts

### What happens
- JAR, WAR, ZIP, Docker image, etc. is created
- Artifact is stored or archived

### Common Tools Used
- Maven / Gradle
- Docker
- Jenkins artifact archiving
- Nexus / Artifactory

Artifacts allow **traceability and rollback**.

---

## Stage 6: Deploy

### Purpose
- Deploy application to an environment

### What happens
- Application is deployed to Dev / QA / Prod
- Configuration is applied

### Common Tools Used
- Shell scripts
- Ansible
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Deployment may be **manual or automatic**, depending on CD strategy.

---

## Stage 7: Post Actions (Notifications & Cleanup)

### Purpose
- Inform teams and clean resources

### What happens
- Notifications are sent
- Temporary files are removed

### Common Tools Used
- Email
- Slack
- Microsoft Teams
- Webhooks

This improves **visibility and collaboration**.

---

## Why Pipelines Are Industry Standard

Pipelines are preferred because they:
- Treat CI/CD as code
- Are version controlled
- Reduce configuration drift
- Support complex workflows
- Scale across teams and projects

Freestyle jobs are good for learning.  
Pipelines are used in production.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Freestyle jobs teach Jenkins fundamentals
- Pipelines define real CI/CD workflows
- Stages represent real delivery steps
- Tools vary per stage, but the flow remains consistent

If you understand **pipeline stages**,  
you understand **real-world CI/CD**.

## What’s Next?

This repository ends after **Jenkins foundations**.

In the continuation repository, we will cover:
- Docker with Jenkins
- Multi-agent pipelines
- Secure credentials
- GitHub Actions
- End-to-end CI/CD projects

You are now ready to move from **basic Jenkins usage** to **professional CI/CD pipelines**.
