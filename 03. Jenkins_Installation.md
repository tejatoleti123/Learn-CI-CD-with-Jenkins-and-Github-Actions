# Jenkins Installation on Amazon Linux (Step-by-Step)

This document provides **very detailed Jenkins installation steps** using **Amazon Linux**.
It is written for beginners and explains **every step**, including the **initial Jenkins UI setup**.

For the latest updates, always refer to the official Jenkins documentation:
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/

---

## Why Amazon Linux?

Amazon Linux is:
- Optimized for AWS
- Commonly used in real-world Jenkins setups
- Well integrated with AWS services
- Free Tier friendly

This guide assumes you are installing Jenkins on an **EC2 instance running Amazon Linux**.

---

## Jenkins Prerequisites

Before installing Jenkins, ensure you have:

- An EC2 instance running **Amazon Linux**
- Port **8080** allowed in the Security Group
- Port **22** allowed for SSH
- Root or sudo access
- Internet access from the instance

---

## Step 1: Connect to the EC2 Instance

From your local machine, connect using SSH:

    ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>

Once connected, you should be logged in as `ec2-user`.

---

## Step 2: Update System Packages

Always update the system before installing new software:

    sudo yum update -y

This ensures package compatibility and security fixes.

---

## Step 3: Install Java (Required for Jenkins)

Jenkins requires Java to run.

Install Amazon Corretto (Java 17):

    sudo yum install java-17-amazon-corretto -y

Verify Java installation:

    java -version

You should see Java 17 in the output.

---

## Step 4: Add Jenkins Repository

Download and add the Jenkins repository configuration:

    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo

Import the Jenkins repository key:

    sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

---

## Step 5: Install Jenkins

Install Jenkins using yum:

    sudo yum install jenkins -y

This installs Jenkins as a system service.

---

## Step 6: Start and Enable Jenkins Service

Start Jenkins:

    sudo systemctl start jenkins

Enable Jenkins to start automatically on reboot:

    sudo systemctl enable jenkins

Check Jenkins status:

    sudo systemctl status jenkins

Jenkins should show as **active (running)**.

---

## Step 7: Access Jenkins from Browser

Open your browser and navigate to:

    http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8080

You will see the **Unlock Jenkins** screen.

---

## Step 8: Get Initial Admin Password

On the EC2 instance, run:

    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Copy the password and paste it into the Jenkins UI.

---

## Step 9: Customize Jenkins (Plugins)

After unlocking Jenkins, you will see the **Customize Jenkins** screen.

Select:

    Install suggested plugins

This installs commonly used plugins required for most CI/CD tasks.

Wait for the plugins installation to complete.

---

## Step 10: Create First Admin User

After plugin installation, Jenkins asks you to create the first admin user.

Fill in:
- Username
- Password
- Full name
- Email address

This user will have full administrative access.

Click **Save and Continue**.

---

## Step 11: Jenkins Ready Screen

Once setup is complete, you will see:

    Jenkins is ready!

Click **Start using Jenkins**.

---

## Step 12: Jenkins Dashboard Overview

You are now redirected to the Jenkins dashboard.

Important areas to notice:
- Dashboard
- User profile
- Build history
- Global search

## Step 13: Plugin Management (Important)

Go to:

    Manage Jenkins → Plugins

This is where you:
- Install new plugins
- Update plugins
- Manage integrations

Example:
- Search for **Docker**
- Install Docker-related plugins when needed

---

## Step 14: Creating First Job (Preview)

Navigate to:

    New Item

You will see job types such as:
- Freestyle project
- Pipeline
- Multi-configuration project

At this stage, **do not create jobs yet**.
Hands-on job creation will be covered in the **next repository**.

---

## Important Security Notes

- Do NOT expose Jenkins publicly without authentication
- Restrict port 8080 using Security Groups
- Use IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials
- Regularly update Jenkins and plugins

---

## What’s Next?

This repository focused on **foundations and setup**.

In the **next repository**, we will cover:
- Jenkins Freestyle jobs
- Jenkins Pipelines
- Docker with Jenkins
- Real-world CI/CD hands-on projects

You are now fully prepared to move into practical CI/CD work.
