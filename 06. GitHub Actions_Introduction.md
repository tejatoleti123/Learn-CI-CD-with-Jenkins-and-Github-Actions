# GitHub Actions – Introduction

This document introduces **GitHub Actions** as a CI/CD platform and explains **why it exists, what problems it solves, and how it fits into modern CI/CD workflows**.

At this stage, the focus is on **understanding concepts**, not writing workflows or YAML files.

---

## What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a **CI/CD and automation platform built directly into GitHub**.

It allows you to automatically:
- Build applications
- Run tests
- Perform code scans
- Deploy applications

based on **events** that occur in a GitHub repository.

Unlike traditional CI tools, GitHub Actions:
- Does not require a separate CI server
- Does not require a separate UI
- Runs automation **inside the GitHub ecosystem**

All automation logic lives **next to your source code**.

---

## Why GitHub Actions Exists

Before GitHub Actions, teams typically:
- Hosted CI tools separately (Jenkins, TeamCity, etc.)
- Managed additional servers
- Integrated CI tools manually with GitHub
- Maintained plugins and credentials

GitHub Actions was introduced to:
- Reduce infrastructure overhead
- Simplify CI/CD setup
- Bring automation closer to the code
- Improve developer experience

The idea is simple:
> **If your code lives in GitHub, your CI/CD can live there too.**

---

## What Problems GitHub Actions Solves

### Traditional CI Challenges

Before GitHub Actions:
- CI lived outside the repository
- Setup and maintenance required effort
- Integrations needed configuration
- Developers depended heavily on DevOps teams

---

### With GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions changes this by:
- Keeping CI/CD configuration inside the repository
- Triggering automation based on GitHub events
- Reducing the need for separate CI infrastructure
- Making automation visible to all contributors

CI/CD becomes:
- Easier to adopt
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to understand

---

## Event-Driven Automation (Key Idea)

GitHub Actions is **event-driven**.

This means automation starts when something happens in GitHub, such as:
- Code is pushed
- A pull request is opened
- A workflow is triggered manually
- A scheduled time is reached

Instead of asking:
> “When should the pipeline run?”

GitHub Actions asks:
> “What event should trigger automation?”

This model fits naturally with Git-based workflows.

## Core Concepts (High-Level)

Before going deeper, it’s important to understand the **basic building blocks**.

| Concept   | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| Workflow | A complete CI/CD automation definition |
| Event    | An action that triggers a workflow |
| Job      | A logical group of steps |
| Step     | An individual task or command |
| Runner   | The machine that executes jobs |

These concepts will be explored **in detail in the next files**.

---

## Where GitHub Actions Workflows Live

All GitHub Actions workflows are stored **inside the repository** under:

    .github/workflows/

Important points:
- Workflow files use **YAML**
- Each file defines:
  - When automation runs
  - What tasks are executed
  - Where those tasks run

At this stage, you do **not** need to write YAML.
Understanding the structure is enough.

---

## Common GitHub Events (Preview)

Some commonly used events include:
- `push` – when code is pushed to a branch
- `pull_request` – when a PR is opened or updated
- `workflow_dispatch` – manual trigger
- `schedule` – time-based execution

These events will be explained **clearly and practically** in the next file.

---

## GitHub Actions vs Traditional CI Tools (High-Level)

| Aspect | GitHub Actions | Traditional CI (e.g., Jenkins) |
|------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Setup | Minimal | Manual |
| Infrastructure | Managed by GitHub | Self-managed |
| Configuration | YAML in repo | UI or code |
| Integration | Native to GitHub | Plugin-based |
| Maintenance | Low | Medium to High |

This is **not a replacement discussion**.  
It is about choosing the **right tool for the right context**.

---

## When GitHub Actions Is a Good Fit

GitHub Actions works especially well when:
- Source code is already on GitHub
- Teams want quick CI/CD setup
- Projects are cloud-native
- Simplicity and visibility are priorities

Many teams use **both Jenkins and GitHub Actions**, depending on requirements.

---

## Key Takeaway

- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub
- Automation is triggered by repository events
- CI/CD logic lives alongside source code
- Infrastructure overhead is reduced
- Concepts matter more than syntax

In the next section, we will explore **workflows in detail** and understand **how GitHub Actions actually executes automation**.
